                    <p>The lion population is estimated to have almost halved during the last quarter century. There are
                        only about 20,000 lions remaining in Africa. The NGW aspires to a doubling of the number of
                        lions, gaining back the half of lions weâ€™ve lost in the past 25 years. Though ambitious, this
                        goal is achievable: recent research indicates that the protected area network alone could
                        support a population of lions three to four times the continental total if they were resourced
                        and managed better.</p>
                    <h5>The NGW has a three-pronged strategy for lion recovery:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Expand the Conservation Footprint
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Build the Will
                        </li>
                        <li>
